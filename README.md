# Mean-Stack-Tutorial
Trying my hands on MEAN Stack. 


Q. What is MEAN Stack?
A: M - MongoDB. Database
   E - ExpressJS. Framework for Node
   A - AngularJS. Frontend framework
   N - NodeJS. Server 

These four parts make up the MEAN stack. (All based on javaScript)
RESTful API: how are we gonna interact the data from our database.


CMD line stuff:

1. npm install express : add express module
2. node server : run the server


Code Stuff:

1. app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public")); //static - html, javascript and CSS file. Telling the server to look for static files in 'public' directory.
